<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This easy chicken alfredo is a quick and easy weeknight meal that is on the table in less than 30 minutes. Made with just a handful of ingredients.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts sliced (or 4 cups cooked cubed chicken)</li>
    <li>Kosher salt to taste</li>    
    <l1>12 ounces dry fettuccini or other long pasta (3/4 box)</l1>
    <l1>2 cups reserved pasta cooking water divided</l1>
    <l1>3/4 cup unsalted butter cubed (1½ sticks)</l1>
    <li>1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese plus more for serving</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh parsley or basil leaves; optional, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta, stirring often, until al dente. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the pasta cooking water.</li>
    <li>Set a large skillet over medium-low heat and add 1-cup pasta water. Bring just to a low simmer, then whisk in 1 tablespoon of butter, one piece at a time, until melted.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the cheese, whisking constantly, being sure it is melted and incorporated thoroughly before adding each addition.</li>
    <li>Whisk in the additional 1-cup pasta water.</li>
    <li>Add the pasta and mix to coat until noodles are covered in sauce.</li>
    <li>(Note - if using cubed chicken, add it now and mix well.)</li>
    <li>Taste and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.</li>
    <li>Cook over low heat, about 3-5 minutes, just until the pasta absorbs most of the liquid. Stir often to avoid scorching the cheese-covered pasta.</li>
    <li>To serve, place ¼ of the pasta on a plate and add 1 sliced chicken breast.</li>
    <li>Top with a heaping helping of grated Parmesan cheese and garnish with chopped fresh parsley or basil leaves.</li>
